    Over the course of the term, the team was able to demonstrate full functionality of the various subsystems on an
individual basis; and was successful in integrating the majority of these parts to work together on a full system level.
Due to limiting factors such as time constraints and availability of on campus pool facilities required for full testing,
the team was unable to complete a final test that integrated the full system architecture.

    The team was able to prove that the design and functionality of the robot was robust, despite many challenges
encountered along the way. Two major findings from the system testing that was completed include the limited
range of infrared light and its attenuation underwater, as well as the need for improved sonar sensors, as the
modules purchased were prone to breaking and had a narrow field of view which indicated a need for numerous sensors,
too many for the interface board to support.

    Future iterations of this project might include a time of flight camera that can modulate IR LEDs at a greater power,
to extend the range. There is even the possibility of using a different wavelength of light and corresponding
sensor, ultraviolet for example, to do depth sensing.

    Ultimately, DORI was successful as a proof of concept for an affordable, mobile, underwater robotic solution for
supplemental safety measures in home and commercial pools. The team was able to meet the design requirements clearly
laid out in the project proposal to address the need for additional safety measures in pools and to make the system
affordable and simple to deploy in the home.
